# Oberoi Realty — Integrity Corpus for IntegriBot

> Internal guidance for generating realistic, non-repetitive, SJT-style integrity dilemmas across roles.
> Use this as *background knowledge* (do not quote). Prefer Indian corporate nuance when relevant.

---

## A. Core Values (anchor)
- **Honesty** (truthful statements, no misrepresentation)
- **Transparency** (disclosure, documentation, auditability)
- **Fairness** (no favoritism, equal treatment, DEI)
- **Accountability** (own mistakes, corrective action)
- **Compliance** (policy, law, anti-bribery, data privacy)
- **Courage** (refuse undue pressure, escalate properly)
- **Respect & EI** (dignity, empathy, bystander intervention)

---

## B. High-Risk Areas (by function)
- **Projects/Construction:** safety shortcuts, substandard materials, forged inspection sign-offs, delaying NCRs.
- **Procurement:** gifts/hospitality, vendor favoritism, split purchases, bid rigging, conflict of interest (COI).
- **Sales/Leasing/CRM:** misrepresenting inventory/amenities, kickbacks, misuse of customer data, side promises.
- **Finance/Accounts:** expense falsification, revenue pull-in, side letters, undocumented cash handling.
- **HR/TA/L&D:** biased hiring, reference fabrication, payroll leaks, mishandling complaints.
- **Facilities/O&M:** pilferage, asset misuse, attendance manipulation, maintenance corners cut.
- **Legal/Compliance:** pressure to “wordsmith” to hide risk, delayed disclosures.
- **IT/Data:** sharing credentials, weak access controls, customer data exports without consent.
- **Admin/Vendor Mgmt:** fake attendance sheets, back-dated gate passes, opaque rate revisions.

---

## C. Stakeholders Catalog
- Internal: direct manager, skip-level, peers, site engineers, QS, HSE, procurement, finance, HR, legal, IT.
- External: vendor PM, subcontractor, client rep, landlord, customer, consultant, auditor, regulator, media.
- Impacted groups: customers/end-users, on-site workforce, community, the brand.

---

## D. Constraint Catalog
Use 2–3 per scenario; vary across dilemmas.
- **Time:** deadline tonight, site inspection scheduled, client launch date imminent.
- **Cost:** over-budget, liquidated damages risk, material wastage already high.
- **Relationship:** long-term vendor/partner, politically connected client, family COI.
- **Data/Safety:** PII involved, structural risk, public safety, environmental compliance.
- **Reputation:** media attention, VIP visit, social media chatter.
- **Ambiguity:** contradictory instructions, outdated SOP, missing approvals.

---

## E. Scenario Patterns (use variety)
1. **Gift/Bribe Pressure** — vendor offers favors to fast-track/approve variations.
2. **Conflict of Interest (COI)** — relative or prior employer is a bidding vendor.
3. **Safety vs Timeline** — HSE flags ignored to meet milestone.
4. **Substandard Materials/Specs** — cheaper substitute pushed as “equivalent”.
5. **Data Privacy/Access** — request to export or share customer/employee data.
6. **Report/Suppress Misconduct** — senior’s error; pressure to keep quiet.
7. **Financial Misstatement** — back-date GRN/invoice; shift cost centers.
8. **Bias/Harassment Bystanding** — overheard bias/harassment; duty to act.
9. **Policy Bypass “Only this once”** — noncompliant shortcut framed as necessity.
10. **Vendor Collusion** — similar bids; insider info leaking; sham competition.
11. **Documentation Fudge** — “clean up” site photos/QA logs post-facto.
12. **CSR/Community Impact** — ignore environmental/traffic/noise compliance.

**For each scenario:** build a clear **ethical tension**, a short **what you do**, and include **escalation path** per policy.

---

## F. Red Flags & Cues
- “Don’t overthink policy”, “everyone does this”, “I’ll make it worth your while”.
- Non-email approvals, WhatsApp only, back-dated sign-offs, verbal commitments.
- Missing three-way match, signature mismatches, altered drawings, reused QR codes.

---

## G. Evaluation Cheatsheet (for the model)
- Reward: disclosure, documentation, policy-first, proportionate escalation (line manager → compliance/HSE/legal), refusal of gifts/COI, corrective action with stakeholder communication.
- Penalize: concealment, retaliation, favoritism, bypasses, personal gain, unsafe acts.

---

## H. Style & Output Rules
- Length 60–110 words. Professional tone. No real names. No confidential numbers.
- Indian corporate/real-estate context acceptable.
- Avoid repetition of exact wording across sessions.
- Difficulty tag: `easy|medium|hard` ~ cognitive load + stakeholder complexity.

---

## I. Examples (micro skeletons)
- **COI (Procurement):** relative in vendor team, pressure to stay on committee → disclose, recuse, ensure fair process.
- **Safety (Projects):** scaffolding inspection skipped due to VIP visit → insist inspection, halt area, escalate to HSE.
- **Data (Sales):** request to export customer list to external broker → refuse, cite policy, propose compliant approach.

(Do not output these verbatim; use as inspiration only.)

## J. Psychometric Anchors
When crafting dilemmas, emulate **Situational Judgement Test (SJT)** psychometric tone:
- Focus on *ambiguity under ethical stress*, not black-and-white choices.
- Reflect **organizational citizenship**, **policy adherence**, and **moral courage**.
- Avoid overly heroic or villainous framing.
- Encourage reflection on “what is right” vs “what is convenient”.
- Example keywords for realism: *deadline*, *vendor*, *audit trail*, *non-conformance*, *escalation matrix*, *policy circular*, *stakeholder pressure*, *approval delay*.

## K. Evaluation Weight (implicit)

- **Integrity under pressure (25%)**
- **Transparency and documentation (20%)**
- **Fairness and compliance (20%)**
- **Courage to escalate or refuse (20%)**
- **Respectful and balanced communication (15%)**
